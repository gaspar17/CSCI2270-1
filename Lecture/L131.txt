Lecture notes from 1/31

you traverse an array using a for loop going through each index
in a linked list you use while(p != NULL)

build a linked list for length n where key is 1-10
  int i = 1
  node *head = new node(i, NULL) this is the head of the list
  node *p = head
  i++
  while(i <= 10,){
    node *n = new node(i, NULL)
    p -> next = n this sets p -> next as a pointer to n
    p = n
    i++
  }
  p = head puts you back at the beginning of the linked list

Inserting a node
  node will either become a new head node, a middle node, or new last node
  since we are using singly linked lists, we have to know previous node

  Search
    node *search(value, node *head)
      node *current = head;
      while(curret != NULL){
        if(current -> key == value =){
          return current;
        }
        current = current -> next;
      }
      return NULL;

  insertNode(previous, value, head)
    node *left = search(previous, head)
    node *n = new node(value, NULL)
    if(left == NULL) //not found
      n -> next = head;
      head = n; //replaces head pointer with the newly created node pointer
