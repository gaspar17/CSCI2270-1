Lecture 2/7

Create 3 files
  1 file where class is defined
  1 file where class is implemented

sll.h
  defines the class

sll.cpp
  implement what's defined in the header file

main.cpp
  use the code from the .h and .cpp

Both cpp files must know about the .h file (#include <sll.h>)

Dynamically allocated memory isnt freed when the class is destroyed
