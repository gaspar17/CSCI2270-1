//Lecture 1/24 Notes

Number bases:
  binary: base 2
  decimal: base 10
  hexadecimal: base 16: 0-F

  what do values mean in binary:
    whether you include a value for a given position (0 no 1 yes)
    8 bits make up one byte
    4 bits is a nibble

  what do values mean in hexadecimal
    uses only nibbles

     8  4  2  1  8  4  2  1
    [1][0][1][0][1][0][1][0]
          A          A

    Decimal = 170
    Hexadecimal = AA

    0x734 = 011100110100

  Pointer - variable that stores a memory address
    Different than a regular variable which directly stores a value
    array name acts as a pointer to the first index of the array
    *(arrayName+1) = arrayName[1]
    Meaning +1 in terms of bytes depends on type of array. for ints +1 is 4 bytes

    changing the value stored in a pointer in an outside function changes it in all other functions
